NOTE: the consequence was originally believed to be only a denial of service (application crash and reboot).
14	CVE-2005-4269			DoS	2005-12-15	2008-09-05	7.8	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Complete	mshtml.dll in Microsoft Windows XP, Server 2003, and Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (access violation) by causing mshtml.dll to process button-focus events at the same time that a document is reloading, as seen in Microsoft Office InfoPath 2003 by repeatedly clicking the "Delete" button in a repeating section in a form. NOTE: the normal operation of InfoPath appears to involve a local user without any privilege boundaries, so this might not be a vulnerability in InfoPath. If no realistic scenarios exist for this problem in other products, then perhaps it should be excluded from CVE.

NOTE: it could be argued that if an attacker already has control over WINS/DNS, then web traffic could already be intercepted by modifying WINS or DNS records, so this would not cross privilege boundaries and would not be a vulnerability. It has also been reported that DHCP is an alternate attack vector.
