NOTE: as of 20070424, Oracle has not disputed reliable claims that this issue occurs because the NTLM SSPI AcceptSecurityContext function grants privileges based on the username provided even though all users are authenticated as Guest, which allows remote attackers to gain privileges.
130	CVE-2007-1973			+Priv	2007-04-11	2018-10-16	6.9	Admin	Local	Medium	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	Race condition in the Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) in the Windows Kernel in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 allows local users to modify memory and gain privileges via the temporary \Device\PhysicalMemory section handle, a related issue to CVE-2007-1206.

137	CVE-2007-1756			Exec Code	2007-07-10	2018-10-30	9.3	Admin	Remote	Medium	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	Microsoft Excel 2000 SP3, 2002 SP3, 2003 SP2, 2003 Viewer, and Office Excel 2007 does not properly validate version information, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Excel file, aka "Calculation Error Vulnerability".
138	CVE-2007-1754	399		Exec Code Bypass	2007-07-10	2018-10-16	9.3	Admin	Remote	Medium	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	PUBCONV.DLL in Microsoft Office Publisher 2007 does not properly clear memory when transferring data from disk to memory, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malformed .pub page via a certain negative value, which bypasses a sanitization procedure that initializes critical pointers to NULL, aka the "Publisher Invalid Memory Reference Vulnerability".
139	CVE-2007-1751	94		Exec Code Mem. Corr.	2007-06-12	2018-10-16	9.3	Admin	Remote	Medium	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01, 6, and 7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by causing Internet Explorer to access an uninitialized or deleted object, related to prototype variables and table cells, aka "Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
140	CVE-2007-1750			Exec Code Mem. Corr.	2007-06-12	2018-10-16	9.3	Admin	Remote	Medium	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	Unspecified vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) tag that triggers memory corruption.
141	CVE-2007-1749			Exec Code Overflow	2007-08-14	2018-10-16	9.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	Integer underflow in the CDownloadSink class code in the Vector Markup Language (VML) component (VGX.DLL), as used in Internet Explorer 5.01, 6, and 7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via compressed content with an invalid buffer size, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
142	CVE-2007-1748	119		Exec Code Overflow	2007-04-13	2019-04-30	10.0	Admin	Remote	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	Stack-based buffer overflow in the RPC interface in the Domain Name System (DNS) Server Service in Microsoft Windows 2000 Server SP 4, Server 2003 SP 1, and Server 2003 SP 2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long zone name containing character constants represented by escape sequences.
143	CVE-2007-1747	399		Exec Code Mem.

144	CVE-2007-1692	16			2007-03-26	2017-07-28	7.5	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	The default configuration of Microsoft Windows uses the Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol (WPAD) without static WPAD entries, which might allow remote attackers to intercept web traffic by registering a proxy server using WINS or DNS, then responding to WPAD requests, as demonstrated using Internet Explorer. NOTE: it could be argued that if an attacker already has control over WINS/DNS, then web traffic could already be intercepted by modifying WINS or DNS records, so this would not cross privilege boundaries and would not be a vulnerability. It has also been reported that DHCP is an alternate attack vector.
145	CVE-2007-1658				2007-03-24	2018-10-16	9.3	Admin	Remote	Medium	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	Windows Mail in Microsoft Windows Vista might allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute certain programs via a link to a (1) local file or (2) UNC share pathname in which there is a directory with the same base name as an executable program at the same level, as demonstrated using C:/windows/system32/winrm (winrm.cmd) and migwiz (migwiz.exe).
146	CVE-2007-1644			DoS	2007-03-23	2017-10-10	10.0	Admin	Remote	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	The dynamic DNS update mechanism in the DNS Server service on Microsoft Windows does not properly authenticate clients in certain deployments or configurations, which allows remote attackers to change DNS records for a web proxy server and conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on web traffic, conduct pharming attacks by poisoning DNS records, and cause a denial of service (erroneous name resolution).
147	CVE-2007-1537			DoS	2007-03-20	2018-10-16	3.6	None	Local	Low	Not required	None	Partial	Partial	\Device\NdisTapi (NDISTAPI.sys) in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and 2003 SP1 uses weak permissions, which allows local users to write to the device and cause a denial of service, as demonstrated by using an IRQL to acquire a spinlock on paged memory via the NdisTapiDispatch function.

149	CVE-2007-1534				2007-03-20	2018-10-16	9.3	Admin	Remote	Medium	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	DFSR.exe in Windows Meeting Space in Microsoft Windows Vista remains available for remote connections on TCP port 5722 for 2 minutes after Windows Meeting Space is closed, which allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact by connecting to this port during the time window.
150	CVE-2007-1533				2007-03-20	2018-10-16	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	Partial	None	The Teredo implementation in Microsoft Windows Vista uses the same nonce for communication with different UDP ports within a solicitation session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof the nonce through brute force attacks.
