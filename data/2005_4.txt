156	CVE-2004-0900			Exec Code	2005-01-10	2018-10-12	10.0	Admin	Remote	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	The DHCP Server service for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server and Terminal Server Edition does not properly validate the length of certain messages, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malformed DHCP message, aka the "DHCP Request Vulnerability."
157	CVE-2004-0899			DoS	2005-01-10	2018-10-12	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	The DHCP Server service for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server and Terminal Server Edition, with DHCP logging enabled, does not properly validate the length of certain messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a malformed DHCP message, aka "Logging Vulnerability."
158	CVE-2004-0897			Exec Code Overflow	2005-01-11	2018-10-12	10.0	Admin	Remote	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	The Indexing Service for Microsoft Windows XP and Server 2003 does not properly validate the length of a message, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a buffer overflow attack.
159	CVE-2004-0894			+Priv	2005-01-10	2019-04-30	7.2	Admin	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) of Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003 does not properly validate connection information, which allows local users to gain privileges via a specially-designed program.
160	CVE-2004-0893			+Priv	2005-01-10	2019-04-30	7.2	Admin	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	The Local Procedure Call (LPC) interface of the Windows Kernel for Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 does not properly validate the lengths of messages sent to the LPC port, which allows local users to gain privileges, aka "Windows Kernel Vulnerability."
161	CVE-2004-0892				2005-01-27	2018-10-12	7.5	User	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0 and Microsoft ISA Server 2000 (which is included in Small Business Server 2000 and Small Business Server 2003 Premium Edition) allows remote attackers to spoof trusted Internet content on a specially crafted webpage via spoofed reverse DNS lookup results.
162	CVE-2004-0848			Exec Code Overflow	2005-02-08	2018-10-12	7.5	User	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	Buffer overflow in Microsoft Office XP allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a link with a URL file location containing long inputs after (1) "%00 (null byte) in .doc filenames or (2) "%0a" (carriage return) in .rtf filenames.
163	CVE-2004-0790			DoS	2005-04-12	2018-10-30	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	Multiple TCP/IP and ICMP implementations allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reset TCP connections) via spoofed ICMP error messages, aka the "blind connection-reset attack." NOTE: CVE-2004-0790, CVE-2004-0791, and CVE-2004-1060 have been SPLIT based on different attacks; CVE-2005-0065, CVE-2005-0066, CVE-2005-0067, and CVE-2005-0068 are related identifiers that are SPLIT based on the underlying vulnerability. While CVE normally SPLITs based on vulnerability, the attack-based identifiers exist due to the variety and number of affected implementations and solutions that address the attacks instead of the underlying vulnerabilities.
164	CVE-2004-0571			Exec Code	2005-01-10	2019-04-30	10.0	Admin	Remote	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	Microsoft Word for Windows 6.0 Converter does not properly validate certain data lengths, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a .wri, .rtf, and .doc file sent by email or malicious web site, aka "Table Conversion Vulnerability," a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-0901.
165	CVE-2004-0568			Exec Code Overflow	2005-01-10	2019-04-30	10.0	Admin	Remote	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	HyperTerminal application for Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 does not properly validate the length of a value that is saved in a session file, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malicious HyperTerminal session file (.ht), web site, or Telnet URL contained in an e-mail message, triggering a buffer overflow.
