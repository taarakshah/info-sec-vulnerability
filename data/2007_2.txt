NOTE: this issue has been disputed by other researchers, citing a variable scoping issue and information about the semantics of document.domain.
75	CVE-2007-3463				2007-06-27	2018-10-16	4.6	None	Local	Low	Single system	None	None	Complete	** DISPUTED ** Microsoft Windows XP SP2 allows local users, who have sessions created by another user's RunAs (run as) command, to kill arbitrary processes of this other user, as demonstrated by the taskkill program.
