Predict the severity of cybersecurity vulnerabilities that are disclosed to the public.

I work with a real life cybersecurity vulnerability dataset obtained from http://www.cvedetails.com. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities are defined as any exploit or security loophole in which a hacker can infiltrate a machine and gain access to auserâ€™s personal files or information (Arora et. al, 2006). The website is sectioned by product vendor and their individual products. From there, information exists on each vulnerability and severity. I want to focus specifically on vulnerabilities for Microsoft products (n=6746 vulnerabilties). From there, I want to compare various machine learning models with R that will predict the severity of future vulnerabilities that are disclosed to the public. The goal of this analysis is to account for some of the missing data, apply different learning algorithms after ensuring assumptions are met, and compare classification performance among the methods. 

Methods: multinomial logistic regression, decision trees, random forest
